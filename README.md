# Linux-Based-Disaster-Recovery-System

This project involves creating a system on a Linux machine that ensures critical data is backed up, secured, and recoverable in the event of data loss, corruption, or hardware failure. It mimics how real-world businesses safeguard their data against disasters like server crashes, accidental deletions, or cyberattacks.
