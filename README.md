# Linux-Based-Disaster-Recovery-System
This project involves creating a system on a Linux machine that ensures critical data is **backed up, secured, and recoverable** in the event of data loss, corruption, or hardware failure. It mimics how real-world businesses safeguard their data against disasters like server crashes, accidental deletions, or cyberattacks.

---

### **What This Project Aims to Do**

1. **Backup**: Automatically copy and store important files or directories.
2. **Secure**: Compress and encrypt the backups to prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Automate**: Use tools like `cron` to schedule backups without manual intervention.
4. **Verify**: Check the integrity of backups to ensure they’re not corrupted.
5. **Restore**: Provide an easy method to restore data from backups.

---

### **Why Is It Important?**

- **Data Protection**: Organizations rely heavily on data. Losing it can be catastrophic.
- **Security**: Backups need to be encrypted to protect against leaks or breaches.
- **Automation**: Manual backups are time-consuming and error-prone, so automation saves effort and ensures reliability.
- **Restoration**: Recovery must be straightforward to minimize downtime during a disaster.

---

### **How It Works**

1. **Backing Up Data**:
   - Use tools like `rsync` to copy files to a backup directory.
   - Compress the files using `tar` to save space.
   - Encrypt the backups using `gpg` to ensure only authorized users can access them.

2. **Scheduling**:
   - Use `cron` to automate the backup process at specific intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).

3. **Integrity Check**:
   - Generate checksums (using tools like `sha256sum`) to validate that the backup files aren’t corrupted.

4. **Restoration**:
   - Decrypt and extract the backup to recover the original files.

---

### **Example Use Case**
Imagine you are managing a small business server. It contains:
- Customer data.
- Financial records.
- Important configuration files.

The disaster recovery system you create will:
1. Automatically back up these files every day at 2 AM.
2. Encrypt the backups and store them securely on the same server or a remote server.
3. Send you an email if the backup fails.
4. Allow you to restore the data quickly if there’s an issue, such as a ransomware attack or accidental file deletion.

---

### **Key Components**
1. **rsync**: Synchronizes files between directories, ensuring only changed files are copied.
2. **tar**: Archives files into a single compressed file.
3. **gpg**: Encrypts files to protect them from unauthorized access.
4. **cron**: Automates tasks like backups at regular intervals.
5. **sha256sum**: Validates file integrity using checksums.

### **What You'll Demonstrate**
- The ability to automate backups.
- Knowledge of Linux tools for compression, encryption, and task scheduling.
- Skills in creating scripts and handling errors.
- A solution for restoring files in a disaster scenario.

---

### **Output of Your Project**
- A **script** that:
  - Backs up data.
  - Encrypts and compresses it.
  - Verifies integrity.
  - Restores data if needed.
- A **demo** showing how your system protects and recovers data.
- **Documentation** explaining the process, tools, and implementation.

---

### **What You'll Learn**
- How to use Linux commands and scripting for real-world tasks.
- The importance of data security and backup systems.
- Practical experience with automation and scheduling tools.
- Problem-solving skills when testing disaster scenarios.

This project is practical, beginner-friendly, and showcases essential skills in **System Administration and Data Management**!
