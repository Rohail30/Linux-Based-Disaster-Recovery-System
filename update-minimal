It seems that you're currently editing the `/etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo` file with `vi`, but it looks like there is still a reference to the old CentOS mirrors, which are no longer available since CentOS 7 has reached end of life.

You need to update this file to point to the **CentOS Vault** repositories for CentOS 7. Here's how you can update the file:

### Update the Repo File to Use the Vault Repositories

1. **Open the `CentOS-Base.repo` file in `vi`:**
   You're already in the correct file. Now let's modify it.

2. **Modify the `[base]`, `[updates]`, and `[extras]` sections**:
   Change the `baseurl` lines to point to the CentOS Vault URLs (you can also comment out the old `mirrorlist` line).

   Here is what the file should look like after modification:

   ```ini
   [base]
   name=CentOS-7 - Base
   baseurl=http://vault.centos.org/7.9.2009/os/x86_64/
   gpgcheck=1
   gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7

   [updates]
   name=CentOS-7 - Updates
   baseurl=http://vault.centos.org/7.9.2009/updates/x86_64/
   gpgcheck=1
   gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7

   [extras]
   name=CentOS-7 - Extras
   baseurl=http://vault.centos.org/7.9.2009/extras/x86_64/
   gpgcheck=1
   gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-7
   ```

   - Make sure to replace all references to `$releasever` and `$basearch` with the version `7.9.2009` and architecture `x86_64`, respectively, as CentOS 7.9 is the final release.
   - If you see a `mirrorlist` line, comment it out by adding a `#` at the beginning of the line.

3. **Save and exit `vi`:**
   - Press `Esc` to exit insert mode.
   - Type `:wq` and press `Enter` to save the changes and exit the editor.

4. **Clean the `yum` cache:**
   After modifying the repository configuration, clean up the `yum` cache to ensure it uses the new configuration:
   ```bash
   yum clean all
   ```

5. **Test the update**:
   Try running an update or installing a package to check if everything is working:
   ```bash
   sudo yum update
   ```

### Next Steps
Now that your repository is set up to use CentOS Vault, you should be able to install packages like `nano` or perform other operations using `yum`.

To temporarily activate the `ens33` network interface using `nmcli` (NetworkManager command-line tool), you can use the following steps:

### Temporarily Activating `ens33` with `nmcli`

1. **Activate the interface**:
   Use the `nmcli` command to bring the `ens33` interface up. This will activate the interface temporarily:

   ```bash
   sudo nmcli device connect ens33
   ```

   This command will bring the `ens33` interface up and assign an IP address if DHCP is enabled for the interface.

2. **Check the status**:
   You can verify that the interface is up by using the following command:

   ```bash
   nmcli device status
   ```

   This will list all network devices and their current status. Ensure that `ens33` is listed as **connected**.

### Optionally, Disable the Interface

If you want to **disable** the interface temporarily, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo nmcli device disconnect ens33
```

### Verify the IP Address

Once the interface is up, you can check if it has an IP address assigned with:

```bash
nmcli device show ens33
```

This will show the details of the `ens33` interface, including the IP address if it has been successfully assigned.

### Summary of Commands

- **Activate the interface**: 
  ```bash
  sudo nmcli device connect ens33
  ```

- **Check device status**: 
  ```bash
  nmcli device status
  ```

- **Disable the interface**: 
  ```bash
  sudo nmcli device disconnect ens33
  ```
