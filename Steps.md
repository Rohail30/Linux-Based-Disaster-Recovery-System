Starting with the **basic Linux-Based Disaster Recovery System** is an excellent way to learn. Here’s a step-by-step guide for building the foundational system without additional features.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Components**
At its core, your system will:
1. **Back Up Data**: Use tools like `tar` and `rsync` to copy files.
2. **Secure the Backup**: Compress and optionally encrypt the backup.
3. **Automate the Process**: Schedule regular backups using `cron`.
4. **Restore Data**: Provide a mechanism to extract backups.

---

### **Step 2: Set Up the Environment**
1. **Create Directories**:
   - A directory to hold your data:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p /home/user/test_data
     ```
   - A directory to store backups:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p /home/user/backup
     ```

2. **Add Mock Data**:
   Populate the test directory with some files to simulate real data:
   ```bash
   echo "This is file 1" > /home/user/test_data/file1.txt
   echo "This is file 2" > /home/user/test_data/file2.txt
   ```

---

### **Step 3: Write the Backup Script**
1. **Create a Script File**:
   - Create a shell script to automate the backup:
     ```bash
     nano /home/user/scripts/backup.sh
     ```

2. **Write the Script**:
   Add the following lines:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Define directories
   SRC="/home/user/test_data"       # Source directory
   DEST="/home/user/backup"         # Destination directory
   DATE=$(date +'%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S') # Current date for naming the backup

   # Step 1: Compress the backup
   tar -czvf $DEST/backup_$DATE.tar.gz $SRC

   # Step 2: Log the completion
   echo "Backup completed at $(date)" >> /home/user/backup/backup.log
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /home/user/scripts/backup.sh
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Test the Backup Script**
Run the script manually to see if it works:
```bash
/home/user/scripts/backup.sh
```

- After running:
  - Check the `/home/user/backup` directory for a `.tar.gz` file.
  - Verify the contents of the archive:
    ```bash
    tar -tzvf /home/user/backup/backup_<date>.tar.gz
    ```

---

### **Step 5: Automate Backups with Cron**
1. **Open Cron Editor**:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. **Schedule the Script**:
   Add this line to schedule the backup daily at 2:00 AM:
   ```bash
   0 2 * * * /home/user/scripts/backup.sh
   ```

3. **Verify the Cron Job**:
   List all scheduled jobs:
   ```bash
   crontab -l
   ```

---

### **Step 6: Create a Restore Script**
1. **Create the Script File**:
   ```bash
   nano /home/user/scripts/restore.sh
   ```

2. **Write the Script**:
   Add the following lines:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   # Define directories
   RESTORE_DIR="/home/user/restored_data"   # Directory to restore data
   BACKUP_FILE="$1"                        # Backup file to restore

   # Step 1: Create the restore directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p $RESTORE_DIR

   # Step 2: Extract the backup
   tar -xzvf $BACKUP_FILE -C $RESTORE_DIR

   echo "Data restored to $RESTORE_DIR"
   ```

3. **Make It Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /home/user/scripts/restore.sh
   ```

4. **Test the Restore Script**:
   - Create a mock restore directory:
     ```bash
     mkdir /home/user/restored_data
     ```
   - Run the restore script:
     ```bash
     /home/user/scripts/restore.sh /home/user/backup/backup_<date>.tar.gz
     ```
   - Verify that the restored files are in `/home/user/restored_data`.

---

### **Step 7: Validate Backup Integrity**
1. **Generate a Checksum**:
   - After each backup, calculate its checksum:
     ```bash
     sha256sum /home/user/backup/backup_<date>.tar.gz > /home/user/backup/backup_<date>.sha256
     ```

2. **Verify the Backup Later**:
   - Check if the file is intact:
     ```bash
     sha256sum -c /home/user/backup/backup_<date>.sha256
     ```

---

### **Step 8: Document the Project**
Write down:
1. **What the system does**:
   - How it creates backups.
   - Where backups are stored.
   - How to restore files.

2. **Key Commands**:
   - The scripts and cron setup.
   - Manual restoration steps.

3. **Screenshots or Logs**:
   - Include evidence of successful backups and restorations.

---

### **Deliverables**
1. Backup and restore scripts (`backup.sh` and `restore.sh`).
2. Cron job configuration for automated backups.
3. A log file showing backup history.
4. A method to verify backup integrity.

---

### **Next Steps**
Once this basic version works:
- Test it by deleting some mock data and restoring it.
- Gradually incorporate additional features (like remote backups or email alerts).
